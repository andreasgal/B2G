This document assumes you've already cloned the b2g repo to the path
$B2G.


 Dependencies
--------------
* IMPORTANT!!: When building on a VM, be sure to give your VM enough
  RAM, swap disk space, and general disk space before beginning.
  Optimally, your VM should have 4GB RAM, 4GB+ swap partition and
  40GB+ virtual hard disk.

* You need to have adb set up to allow your machine to talk to your
  phone.  Follow the instructions at

    http://developer.android.com/guide/developing/device.html

  Note when setting up udev, you need to specify the identifier for
  your device's manufacturer in *lower case* hex.  That is,

    ATTR{idVendor}=="0bb4"

  not "0BB4".  If you use upper-case hex, the USB permissions will not
  be set up correctly and heimdall will only work if you give it
  superuser powers.

* When building B2G for the first time, don't forget to run 'make gonk' first.

* If you're building for the Galaxy S II, you need to install
  "Heimdall" to be able to flash your phone with B2G.  Follow the
  instructions at

    http://www.glassechidna.com.au/products/heimdall/

  (Even if you're not building for the Galaxy S II, it's not a bad
  idea to install Heimdall anyway.)

* There are a few other dependencies you may find necessary to
  install.  These were found to be necessary when building on a ubuntu
  64bit system.

    # sudo apt-get install ia32-libs gcc-multilib g++-multilib bison \
      flex gperf lib32z1-dev lib32ncurses5-dev lib32ncursesw5-dev \
      libidl-dev lib32gomp1 autoconf2.13 ccache libx11-dev \
      lib32readline-gplv2-dev

  lib32readline-gplv2-dev is available for Ubuntu 11.10. For Ubuntu 10.10
  lib32readline5-dev seems to work fine.


 Quick start
-------------

 == Samsung Galaxy SII ==

Getting a download-mode jig is recommended before attempting this.

$ cd $B2G
$ make sync
$ make config-galaxy-s2
$ make kernel
$ adb reboot download
$ heimdall flash --kernel boot/kernel-android-galaxy-s2/arch/arm/boot/zImage
$ adb reboot recovery

This will reboot your phone into CWM-based recovery.
Use the volume up and down keys and home key to navigate the menus
and back up your device.

$ make gonk
$ make flash

 == Android Emulator ==

$ cd $B2G
$ make sync
$ make config-qemu
$ make gonk
$ make
$ ./emu.sh

 Detailed instructions
-----------------------

These instructions assume you have followed the directions in the
"Dependencies" section.

 == Initialize repository ==

The repository is organized as a top-level B2G module with many
submodules for the kernel, gecko, and other userspace libraries.
Before doing anything else, you need to synchronize all these
submodules

$ cd $B2G
$ make sync

This takes a *long* time, so be patient.  Whenever you want to pull
from upstream again, just re-run |make sync|.

 == Configure repo for your device ==

 Galaxy S II:
$ make config-galaxy-s2

 Android Emulator:
$ make config-qemu

This configures submodules appropriately for the given device, and for
devices with proprietary libraries, will attempt to download and
install the blobs.  The blobs may ask you to agree to an EULA before
they will install.

 == Build the code ==

When building for the first time, first run:

$ make gonk

Then simply run:

$ make

This step can take a long time.  Subsequent rebuilds will usually be
much faster, though.

 == Running on the Android Emulator ==

At this stage, if you're building for the Android emulator, you just
need to run the provided script and you're done.

$ ./emu.sh

 == Kernel Flashing / Device Backup [Galaxy S II] ==

The kernel should be flashed when using the gonk backend on a SII.
It should only be done once or when the kernel is updated.
This kernel comes with a clockwork mod variant.

GET A DOWNLOAD MODE JIG BEFORE ATTEMPTING THIS!
The flashing process is known to fail.

$ make kernel
$ adb reboot download

This puts your phone into "download mode", in which it's ready to be
flashed using the "Odin" protocol.  Your phone should boot into a
screen that says something like, "Downloading, Do not turn off!".  If
not, something went wrong.  To actually flash the kernel:

$ heimdall flash --kernel boot/kernel-android-galaxy-s2/arch/arm/boot/zImage

Note: If during "make kernel" the process seems to stop and shows a colon for user input, it's probably asking you a question. Try hitting enter to continue.

When this finishes, your phone should reboot normally.  If not,
something went wrong, get help.  Finally, let's back up your phone's
current image

$ adb reboot recovery

This boots your phone into a screen that says "CWM-based Recovery"
at the top-left.  Follow the on-screen instructions to make a backup
image.

 == Flash device ==

The "image" to be flashed comprises the custom-built kernel and all
the userspace programs and libraries.

WARNING: Make sure you back up before the next command. If the image
is bad, it can also *BRICK* your phone.  Flash at your own risk.

$ make flash-only

If all goes well, you'll see the phone reboot into the bootloader,
then your host machine will report the progress of files it uploads
and installs on the device.  After finishing, the device will reboot.

 == Install Gaia ==

Gaia is the phone experience prototype being developed by Mozilla. It
is built into the system image by default. To update gaia on a flashed
device, run

$ make install-gaia

If you press the "Home" button on device, the Gaia homescreen will
reload.


Happy hacking.
